# odin-recipes

First project for TOP.

The goal is to create a mini recipe websites.\
It should contain a main page, and several different recipe pages with basic content.\
No CSS for now. This is just a project to review HTML basics.\
I will create recipe content with an LLM, on the side, because I don't know recipes by heart and I'm lazy.\
